## LUDICOLO

We have a bunch of certificates and a flag that is encrypted for one of these certificates. All RSA parameters underlying these certificates were generated by the same source.

This challenge was served as YAROCA during the proto.vision CTF (2017) by the AIVD, the Dutch intelligence and security service.

Flag is of the form so{<32 hexadecimal charachters>}. Submit your flag at the Squeamish Ossifrage <a href='https://squeamishossifrage.eu'>website</a>.
