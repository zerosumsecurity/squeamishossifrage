The key used to encrypt the flag has been secret shared over the integers, and according to the Shamir you need 5 of these shares to reconstruct it. You get only 3 of them.

Inspired by, but much easier than, the Reality challenge from the Google CTF 2019. (Excellent write-up <a href='https://colab.research.google.com/github/nguyenduyhieukma/CTF-Writeups/blob/master/Google%20CTF%20Quals/2019/reality/reality-solution.ipynb'>here</a>.) Idea came from <a href= 'https://twitter.com/gijs_h'>@gijs_h</a> who pointed out the Reality challenge over the integers could be almost trivially solved without lattices.

Flag is of the form so{<32 hexadecimal charachters>}. Submit your flag at the Squeamish Ossifrage <a href='https://squeamishossifrage.eu'>website</a>.
